Note:
Hi, I'm ishotjr; I'm not big on hierarchy so I prefer to go by "Lead Emoji Sprinkler" at Rebble, since I'm notorious for my overuse of emoji reactions and in blog posts and ... anywhere else it's possible to use emojis.  The last link here is the repo for this presentation - if you press `s` while viewing it you can see my speaker notes which include a ton of source links and other fun facts!

## Pebble is dead.

on December 7th, 2016, [Pebble announced that they were ceasing operations](https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003113/https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/)

## Long live Pebble!

two days later, on December 9th, 2016, [the Rebble web site went live](https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html), announcing our intention to "maintain and advance Pebble functionality, in the absence of Pebble Technology Corp."

## the long version!
Note:
that was the short version; would you like to hear a slightly longer version?  

## it started in Delft!
Note:
I'm not sure if any of you were aware of this, but this ThingsCon Salon is a homecoming of sorts - Pebble actually started out as a bike computer - an idea that founder Eric Migicovsky had while riding his opafiets ("grandpa bike") to class at Delft University of Technology!  

## Watchduino
Note:
Eric's [first prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPt5SnKrDI8) was a custom Arduino-based PCB with a couple of buttons, a small LiPo battery, and a screen scavenged from a Nokia 3310.  It displayed SMS messages, music track information, and - oh yeah - it also told the time!

## the Allerta inPulse
Note:
The Watchduino prototype eventually evolved into the [inPulse smartwatch](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105155457/http://www.getinpulse.com/specs) for BlackBerry (and was eventually made compatible with some Android devices).  They were accepted into the [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) program (spoiler: [Eric became a partner](https://blog.ycombinator.com/welcome-eric-holly-diego-matt-nic-kyle-adele-jose-matt-ramon-and-gia/) there post-Pebble) and after running into difficulty funding their next evolution, [turned to Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android), where they raised 10 times their $100,000 goal in 28 hours, eventually exceeding 100 times the original target with a final total of $10.2MM - [a Kickstarter record at the time](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android/posts/209297) - and a [record still held by Pebble](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/most-funded) with the subsequent [Pebble Time campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises).  



## my Pebble story
Note:
So, that's a little history on Pebble - I wanted to share my own story to help explain my passion for these devices and what drives me to keep them alive long after others may consider them "obsolete".  

### Kickstarter
Note:
Pebble was the first Kickstarter project I had ever backed, and I was actually pretty disappointed with the delays (I chose grey, and it shipped after black Pebbles were already available on store shelves) - and then when it finally arrived it had a screen tearing issue right out of the box (but was quickly replaced).  
TODO: Kickstarter/PebblePressPack1  

### SDK
#### PW-DOS
Note:
Usually when I get a thing, my first instinct is to start hacking on it, but the [early SDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20120523103349/https://pebblewatch.heroku.com/blog/2012/04/10/pebble-sdk/) was a bit intimidating, and I played with [`SDK 2.0-BETA1`](https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/sdk/changelogs/2.0-BETA1/index.html), but it wasn't until [Developer Preview releases of 3.0](https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/sdk/changelogs/3.0-dp1/index.html) in preparation for the upcoming Pebble Time that I really started actively developing for Pebble.  I published my [PW-DOS Command Line Watchface](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/550f2f3a46cb79c9bc000044?native=false&query=pw-dos&section=watchfaces) based on one of the tutorials and it's still my daily driver to this day!

### Pebble Rocks Boulder
Note:
once I got into Pebble dev, however, it became an addiction - there's just something really rewarding about wearing your work on your wrist all day, every day - I'd forego pretty much all sleep most weekends exploring new SDK features and ideas - and then a friend and I found out about the [Pebble Rocks Boulder hackathon](https://www.hackster.io/hackathons/pebble-rocks-boulder/a-pebble-hackathon) at which the fabled smartstrap functionality would be unveiled, allowing external hardware to interface with Pebble devices (I'd been working on prototypes already in anticipation of the firmware that enabled it).

### Time for Another Round (Ottawa)
#### layoffs?!
Note:
half a year flew by, and after the amazing experience I'd had at PRB (we won, but the real prize was getting to meet so many other Pebble devs and even real, live Pebblers!), I jumped at the opportunity to attend another hackathon (I say "jumped" but what I really mean is "drove 10 hours into the freezing North"!).  Another amazing event (and another win) *but* with [Pebble having just laid off 25% of its workforce](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292742/pebble-laying-off-25-percent-of-staff), the Pebble staff who were originally to attend had to cancel their plans.

### Pebble A2 (Rockstar)
#### the book
#### appstore curation
Note:
as a result of the Ottawa hackathon, I gained the confidence to start a meetup here in Ann Arbor (aka became a Pebble "Rockstar" which also granted me special access to devrel staff), and embraced every possible avenue by which to become involved, including helping with [the book](https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/) and appstore curation.

### Pokemon GO Radar
### smartstraps
Note:
Meanwhile I continued to spend all of my time on Pebble development, such as the [Pokemon GO Radar Pebble Watchapp](http://ishotjr.com/pokemon-go-radar-pebble-watchapp-poc/) (#10 game of all time!) and [PW-DOS Keyboard Smartstrap](http://ishotjr.github.io/2015/11/29/pw-dos-touchscreen-keyboard-pebble-smartstrap.html)

## rumours and discord
### The Information
Note:
As I mentioned, Pebble had already had layoffs in March of 2016, and [rumours abounded](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/even-with-18-million-in-the-bank-rumor-has-it-that-pebble-is-on-the-rocks/) from then on.  As a *Rockstar* I had some additional insight, such as the annual Developer Retreat seeming increasingly unlikely to happen - allegedly due to pressure to ship the Pebble 2, Pebble Time 2, and Core (in retrospect I wonder if they were in fact working on the final "kitchen sink" release!).  Then late on November 30th, someone posted The Information's (paywalled) scoop [Fitbit To Buy Pebble](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fitbit-to-buy-pebble) to the developer chat, which then echoed (though with no additional firm evidence) across the tech blogs - and we all started to freak out.  
TODO: information screen cap    

### confirmation
Note:
The next week was a confusing time, as Pebble had not confirmed any of the rumours - instead Tweeting and running giveaway contests as if nothing was wrong, as well as promising a long-overdue Kickstarter update.  Some really, really strange things happened during this period, such as the [famous "shrug" Tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/5fumcz/whatwhat_does_this_mean/dan83rh/) and the [(alleged?) hacking of a Pebble team member's Reddit account, resulting in a frank confirmation of Fitbit's acquisition](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/5gbpsx/official_pebble_short_update_post_is_not_official/) - which was denied - then [officially announced on December 7th](https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003113/https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/).
TODO: shrug  

### a loveletter
Note:
When we finally received official confirmation, I penned an open - no, a [*love* letter to Pebble and the community that had grown around it](http://ishotjr.com/a-love-letter-to-pebble-and-the-pebble-community/).  I included in it links to resources such as the [pebble-dev wiki](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki) where we'd start to amass resources for post-Pebble survival, and the [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/aRUAYFN) where we were all congregating.  [Pebble Tweeted a link to my blog post](https://twitter.com/Pebble/status/806733571041861632) which helped spread awareness of our efforts beyond the Pebble dev core.  
TODO: tweet  

### Rebbleion
Note:
Two days after Pebble's announcement, [the Rebble web site went live](
https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html), declaring our intent to "bring the many disparate efforts under a single banner, concentrating energy and enthusiasm to maximize the likelihood of continuance and resurgence of Pebble as a platform" as well as introducing the [Team](http://rebble.io/team/) and [Projects](http://rebble.io/projects/).  
TODO: team cap  



## wiki, archive and reveng
Note:
The next few weeks were a frantic outpouring of productivity - each team member focused on their area of expertise or a feature they were particular passionate about preserving, and by December 19th, we had replacement Android and iOS apps underway, a new appstore frontend largely completed, and heaps of insight into the inner working of our beloved Pebbles.  

### appstore
Note:
Less than two weeks after Pebble's announcement, the [appstore API](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Appstore#api-info) had already been [reverse-engineered](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Reverse-Engineering-the-Official-App-Store), including overriding the [bootloader URI](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Mobile-Application-URI-Bootstrap) to [load an alternative version in iOS](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Appstore#new-host-your-own-app-appstore-in-the-pebble-ios-app).  

### firmware
Note:
Meanwhile, the firmware team [used IDA to reverse engineer the Pebble Time firmware](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Assorted-IDA-notes) and hack together new, FreeRTOS-based firmware capable of drawing to its display!  

### archive
Note:
Additionally, the Pebble appstore, documentation, and other important data had all been backed up for posterity.
